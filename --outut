The capital cities of U.S. states are usually well-known, but sometimes people might confuse them with larger cities. For example, some people might think the capital is Oklahoma City because it's the largest city in the state. But wait, actually, I remember that the capital of Oklahoma is Oklahoma City. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, there was a time when Guthrie was the capital before 1910. But after that, they moved it to Oklahoma City. Let me confirm that. Yes, in 1910, the capital was moved from Guthrie to Oklahoma City. So currently, the capital is Oklahoma City. Therefore, the answer should be Oklahoma City. I need to make sure there's no confusion here. Let me check another source. Yes, multiple sources confirm that Oklahoma City is the capital.
