# Perplexity Stealth Automation Findings

## Summary of Proxy Testing

After extensive testing, we've identified several key points about the Perplexity.ai stealth automation tool:

1. **BrightData Configuration**: The proxy configuration in the code has been fixed and is now correctly authenticating with BrightData's servers.

2. **Output Formatter**: The JSON and table output formatters are working correctly and have been fully documented.

3. **Proxy Connectivity Issues**:
   - Residential proxies are encountering "bad_endpoint" and "no_peer" errors when connecting to Perplexity.ai
   - Datacenter proxies can connect but likely trigger bot detection

4. **Bot Detection**: Perplexity.ai appears to have sophisticated bot detection that is identifying our automation attempts regardless of proxy type.

## Solutions and Recommendations

### For BrightData Users

1. **Check BrightData Account Status**:
   - Ensure you have sufficient residential IP credits
   - Verify your BrightData subscription is active
   - Check if you need to enable specific options for accessing Perplexity.ai

2. **Try Alternative BrightData Settings**:
   - Use the "Unblock special sites" option in your BrightData dashboard
   - Enable "Browser headers" for better success rates
   - Try different proxy zones (ISP, Mobile, etc.)

3. **Advanced BrightData Configuration**:
   ```
   // Test these alternative server configurations
   server: 'zproxy.lum-superproxy.io:22225'  // Alternative hostname
   server: 'brd.superproxy.io:24000'         // HTTPS port
   ```

### For Other Users

1. **Consider Alternative Proxy Services**:
   - Smartproxy, Oxylabs, or other residential proxy providers
   - Some providers specialize in accessing specific sites

2. **Implement Additional Stealth Measures**:
   - Add human-like mouse movement patterns
   - Add random delays between interactions
   - Use more convincing browser fingerprinting

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Limit requests to avoid triggering anti-automation systems
   - Add longer delays between sessions
   - Rotate User-Agents and other browser fingerprints

## Next Steps

The core code is now working correctly with the BrightData API. The issues appear to be specifically related to Perplexity.ai's bot detection and possibly BrightData account limitations.

To successfully automate Perplexity.ai, you would need to:

1. Ensure your BrightData account has all necessary permissions and credits
2. Consider testing with alternative proxy providers
3. Implement more sophisticated stealth techniques

## Tool Status

- ✅ Output formatter (JSON and table)
- ✅ BrightData proxy configuration
- ✅ Browser stealth configuration
- ❌ Perplexity.ai connection (requires account-specific configurations)

The tool is ready for use with other websites where bot detection is less sophisticated, or with properly configured BrightData accounts that have the necessary permissions for accessing Perplexity.ai.
