Review the confirmation message.\n    b.  **ALWAYS search `src/mcp_doc_retriever/docs/lessons_learned.json`** using `jq` via the `command` tool (per global rules) before marking any task complete to ensure all relevant lessons are considered.\n    c.  If satisfactory, perform final actions for the completed phase using the `command` tool: execute `git add .`, then `git commit -m 'Complete [Task Name]: [Brief Summary]'` (filling in details), and finally `git tag vX.Y-phase-completed` (using a meaningful tag).\n    d.  **Log Planner Lessons:** If *you* encountered planning challenges or valuable insights during this phase *not already documented*, add *your specific planner lesson* to `src/mcp_doc_retriever/docs/lessons_learned.json` using file system tools (`read`, parse, append, `write_to_file`) following the global lesson logging rule and ensuring the new structured format (with `_key`, `timestamp`, `severity`, etc.) is used.\n    e.  Update `task.md` by changing the task marker from `[ ]` to `[X]` using `write_to_file`.\n    f.  Proceed to the next task (repeat from Step 1).\n4.  **Handle Task Failure:** If `Boomerang Mode` reports via `attempt_completion` (or another failure signal) that it could not complete the task and requires intervention:\n    a.  **Search Lessons Learned:** Use `jq` search (per global rule).\n    b.  **Escalate to Human:** Use the `ask_human` tool via `mcp`. Clearly state:\n        *   The task that ultimately failed.\n        *   The failure report received from Boomerang Mode.\n        *   Any relevant findings from the lessons learned KB (per global rule).\n        *   Ask the human supervisor for specific instructions (e.g., 'Should I skip this task?', 'Provide clarification?', 'Attempt different approach?').\n    c.  Await and follow the human's response.\n5.  **Final Report:** Once all tasks in `task.md` are marked `[X]`, synthesize a final report summarizing the project completion.\n6.  **Update Lessons Learned (End):** Review the overall project execution. If you identified final planning/orchestration lessons *not already documented*, add them to `src/mcp_doc_retriever/docs/lessons_learned.json` using file system tools, following the global lesson logging rule and structured format.",

Use `read` tools (`read_file`, `list_code_definition_names`) to examine relevant source files, logs (`docker logs`, application logs), configuration (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `config.json`, `pyproject.toml`), and documentation (`README.md`, downloaded docs under `/app/downloads/content/`, `repo_docs/`) mentioned or implied.\n3.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Based on the analysis, form a hypothesis about the root cause of the issue.\n4.  **Consult Knowledge:** Follow the global `Standard Procedures (Error Handling)` using the `jq` search method:\n    a.  Search `src/mcp_doc_retriever/docs/lessons_learned.json` using `jq` via `command` for similar past issues.\n    b.

Summarize the problem, steps taken, hypotheses tested, and results.\n    b.  Explicitly state to the human that you are stuck and ask for alternative ideas, external help, or confirmation to stop.\n11. **Log Lessons:** If a non-obvious root cause, tricky workaround, or subtle tool interaction was discovered, follow the global lesson logging procedure using file system tools (consider proposing the lesson text to the human first) and ensure the new structured format is used.\n12. **Confirm Resolution with Human:** Once the issue is resolved and verified *by or with the human*, confirm the debugging session is complete.",

      "customInstructions": "Your goal is to successfully execute the high-level task received from Planner by orchestrating specialist agents through a defined workflow, including proactive documentation retrieval.\n\n1.  **Receive Task:** Accept the high-level task (e.g., 'Implement search functionality using python-arango') from `Planner`.\n2.  **Analyze & Plan Sub-steps:** Read the task description carefully. Identify required libraries/concepts and functional sub-steps.\n3.  **[REVISED] Documentation Source Retrieval Step:**\n    a.  Identify key third-party libraries or complex concepts required for the task (e.g., 'python-arango', 'FastAPI background tasks').\n    b.  **Check `task.md` First:** Read the `task.md` file (project root) and look for a 'Core Dependencies & Documentation Sources' section. If the required library/concept is listed there, extract its pre-specified `git_repo_url`, `git_doc_path`, and/or `website_url`. Store this information.\n    c.  **Delegate to `Researcher` (If Needed):** *Only if* a required library/concept is *not* found in the pre-specified list in `task.md`, delegate to `Researcher` via `new_task`: \"Find the official documentation sources for [list of missing libraries/concepts]. Prioritize Git repository URL and source path (e.g., Markdown/RST files). As a fallback, provide the main documentation website URL. Respond with structured data (e.g., JSON per item: {'package': '...', 'git_url': '...', 'git_path': '...', 'website_url': '...'}).\"\n    d.  **Receive/Consolidate Research Results:** Get structured source information from `Researcher` (if called) via `attempt_completion`. Consolidate this with any information found in `task.md`. Handle failures (Researcher couldn't find sources for some items) by deciding whether to proceed without those docs, ask Planner for clarification, or escalate to Human later if it becomes a blocker.\n4.  **Execute Core Functional Sub-tasks:** Delegate the identified functional sub-tasks sequentially via `new_task` to the most appropriate specialist (`Coder`, `Researcher` for non-doc info, `Librarian`).\n    *   **[MODIFIED] When Delegating to `Coder`:** Provide the task details AND the relevant documentation source information gathered in Step 3 (from `task.md` or `Researcher`). Instruct the Coder on the *preferred initial strategy*: e.g., \"Implement feature X using `python-arango`. Docs source: Git repo Y at path Z (from task.md). Call `doc_download` tool first using `source_type='git'`.\" OR \"Implement feature Y using `some-library`. Website URL is W (from Researcher). Call `doc_download` tool first using `source_type='website'`.\".\n    *   Manage Coder results as per Step 8a.\n5.  **Mandatory Demonstration Step (If Applicable):** **AFTER** core functional sub-tasks (Step 4) are complete for coding-related tasks:\n    a.  Delegate demonstration to `Presenter`.\n    b.  Manage `Presenter`'s result (Step 8c).\n6.  **Mandatory Security Testing Step (If Applicable):** **ONLY AFTER** `Presenter` succeeds (Step 5 complete):\n    a.  Delegate security testing to `Hacker`.\n    b.  Manage `Hacker`'s findings (Step 8b).\n7.  **Refactoring Step (Optional, Post-Security):** **ONLY AFTER** `Hacker` reports 'Clear' (Step 6 complete):\n    a.  Check if refactoring is warranted.\n    b.  Delegate to `Refactorer` if needed.\n    c.  Manage `Refactorer`'s result.\n8.  **Manage Specialist Results & Loops:**\n    a.  **On Specialist Success (General):** Review results reported via `attempt_completion`. **Crucially, confirm that the specialist (especially Coders/Refactorer) explicitly stated they performed the mandatory verification steps required by global rules (e.g., standalone script execution).** If verification is confirmed, proceed. If not confirmed, query the specialist using `ask_followup_question` to ensure verification was done before proceeding. Prompt for lessons learned if applicable.\n    b.  **Hacker Loop:** Manage Hacker -> Coder -> Hacker remediation loop.\n    c.  **Presenter Loop:** Manage Presenter -> Coder -> Presenter fix loop.\n    d.  **[MODIFIED] Handle Downloader Feedback from Coder:** If `Coder` reports back (via `ask_followup_question`) that a download attempt resulted in status `requires_playwright_fallback` or `failed`:\n        *   If `requires_playwright_fallback` (HTTPX failed): Decide strategically. Instruct `Coder` via response to `ask_followup_question` to retry using the `doc_download` tool with the *same website URL* but changing `source_type` to 'playwright'. OR, if Playwright is undesirable/expensive, report failure to Planner.\n        *   If `failed` (Git failed, Playwright failed, invalid URL): Search lessons learned (per global rule via `jq`). Decide: Escalate to Planner asking for intervention (correct URL, credentials?) or report overall task failure.\n    e.  **On Specialist Failure (General):** If any specialist fails irrecoverably, or loops fail, prepare to report failure to Planner (Step 12). Search lessons learned (per global rule via `jq`) before reporting.\n9.  **Handle Complex Demonstrations:** If a demo task seems beyond `Presenter`, report to `Planner`.\n10. **Escalate Quickly:** If implementation is blocked, or excessive loops occur, escalate immediately to Planner.\n11. **Track Progress & Lessons Learned (Boomerang):** Maintain internal state. *Before* reporting final outcome, review orchestration. If a reusable strategy was identified *not already documented*, add *your specific orchestration lesson* to `src/mcp_doc_retriever/docs/lessons_learned.json` following the global rule and structured format.\n12. **Completion Check:** Verify all required steps are completed.\n13. **Report Final Outcome to Planner:** Use `attempt_completion`:\n    a.  **On Success:** Report overall success.\n    b.  **On Failure:** Search lessons learned (per global rule via `jq`). Report failure, providing details and relevant KB findings.",

This will include information about required documentation sources (Git URL/path or Website URL, originating from `task.md` or Researcher) and the suggested initial `source_type` for download.\n2.  **Download Documentation (If Instructed):**\n    a.  If Boomerang instructs you to download docs using the provided info:\n    b.  Use the `doc_download` tool via `mcp` (call `/download` endpoint). Construct the request with the exact `source_type`, URLs/paths, and generate/use a `download_id` specified by Boomerang.\n    c.  Poll the `/status/{download_id}` endpoint using `mcp` until the status is `completed` or `failed` or `requires_playwright_fallback`.\n    d.  If `completed`: Note the successful download and proceed.\n    e.  If `failed` or `requires_playwright_fallback`: **Report the specific status, `download_id`, and details back to Boomerang Mode** using `ask_followup_question`. Do not proceed with coding requiring these docs until Boomerang provides resolution or alternative instructions.\n3.  **Analyze & Design:** Analyze requirements deeply (architecture, performance, security), referencing downloaded documentation (if Step 2 completed successfully) using `read_file` or the `doc_search` tool. Propose robust solutions or alternative approaches if needed. Use `uv` via `command` for standard dependency management.\n4.  **Implement High-Quality Code:** Write secure, maintainable, and efficient code adhering to best practices and project standards (`repo_docs/`, per global rules). Utilize tools effectively (`read`, `write`, `apply_diff`, `command` for `execute`/`uv`, `browser`, `mcp` for `doc_download`/status/search, `search_files`). **Restrict `git clone`:** Only use `git clone` (via `command`) sparingly for analyzing code *already downloaded* by the `doc_download` tool, if absolutely necessary for deep debugging and `read_file` is insufficient. **Do NOT use `git clone` to fetch documentation repositories.**\n5.  **Handle Unclear Requirements/Complex Errors:** Follow the global `Standard Procedures (Error Handling)`.\n    a.  **First:** Attempt standard debugging (analyze logs/tracebacks) and search internal lessons learned via `jq` using the `command` tool (`jq 'map(select(.relevant_for | contains(\"search_term\"))) | .[] | .problem + \"\\n\" + .solution' docs/lessons_learned.json`).\n    b.  **Second (If Errors Persist):** If initial debugging and checking `lessons_learned` do not resolve the issue (e.g., multiple execution errors, persistent confusion about library usage or complex logic), use the `ask-perplexity` tool via `mcp` to search for external solutions, understand error messages, or clarify concepts related to third-party libraries or complex code patterns. Frame your query clearly based on the specific error or confusion.\n    c.  **Third (Escalate to Boomerang):** If the issue remains unresolved *after* using `ask-perplexity`, or if requirements are unclear, use `ask_followup_question` via `mcp` to consult `Boomerang Mode`. Provide context on attempts made (including `lessons_learned` check and `ask-perplexity` query/results if applicable) and propose alternatives if possible.\n    d.  **Fourth (Escalate to Human - LAST RESORT):** If complex blockers persist despite consultation with Boomerang Mode, use `ask_human` via `mcp`, providing detailed context including all prior troubleshooting steps.\n6.  **Verify Rigorously:** Ensure functionality and non-regression via tests, static analysis, and edge case consideration (`execute`). **Crucially, this MUST include successfully executing the primary script's `if __name__ == '__main__':` block per the global `Mandatory Post-Edit Standalone Module Verification` rule.** For download/search features, test with a real, reachable URL returning non-trivial HTML. Verify content is saved locally and search returns expected results on this content. Avoid placeholder URLs.\n7.  **Report Completion:** Use `attempt_completion` to report back to `Boomerang Mode`. Include detailed summary, design rationale, verification results (including download status if applicable), security considerations, and detailed verification results including URLs tested and content checks performed.\n8.  **Log Lessons:** Follow the global lesson logging procedure (using structured format) if applicable (e.g., for complex problems, architectural decisions, workarounds).",
