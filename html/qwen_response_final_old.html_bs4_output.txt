Okay, so I need to find out what the capital of Rhode Island is. Let me think. I know Rhode Island is one of the states in the United States. It's a small state, I think, located in the northeastern part. The name "Rhode Island" might be a bit confusing because it's actually a colony that became a state, right? But the question is about its capital.
First, I should recall if I've heard the name of the capital before. Maybe in school or somewhere else. I remember that some state capitals have similar names to the state itself, like Sacramento for California, but that's not always the case. For example, the capital of New York is Albany, not New York City. So maybe Rhode Island's capital is a different city.
Wait, I think I've heard the name Providence before. Is that the capital? Providence, Rhode Island. Let me check that. Providence is a city in Rhode Island, and I think it's the largest city there. But is it the capital? Sometimes the largest city isn't the capital. For instance, in California, the capital is Sacramento, not Los Angeles or San Francisco. Similarly, in New York, as I mentioned earlier, it's Albany.
Alternatively, maybe the capital is Newport? No, Newport is a well-known city in Rhode Island, famous for its mansions and yachting. But I don't think it's the capital. Another possibility could be Warwick, which is another city in Rhode Island. But again, not sure.
Wait, let me think of other capitals in New England states. For example, Boston is the capital of Massachusetts, Concord for New Hampshire, Montpelier for Vermont, Augusta for Maine, and Hartford for Connecticut. So Rhode Island's capital would be another city.
I think the correct answer is Providence. Let me verify. If I recall correctly, Providence was founded in 163
