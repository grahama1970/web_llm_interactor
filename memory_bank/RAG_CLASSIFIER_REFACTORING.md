# RAG Classifier Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring of the RAG classifier to use local embeddings with ArangoDB.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `arango_setup.py`**
   - Modified to use `memory_bank` database with a `complexity` collection
   - Added configuration for ArangoDB views and vector indexes
   - Added a validation process for verifying the setup

2. **Created a new `populate_db.py` script**
   - Added functionality to load sample labeled data (Simple/Complex questions)
   - Implemented embedding using ModernBERT (local version)
   - Structured data with question, label, and embedding fields

3. **Modified `rag_classifier.py`**
   - Updated `EmbedderModel` class to use local embeddings from `complexity.utils.embedding_utils.get_local_embedding`
   - Fixed variable naming issues and updated method calls
   - Added fallback to mock data if ArangoDB isn't properly set up
   - Implemented semantic matching with cosine similarity

4. **Fixed AQL query handling**
   - Updated to use string replacement instead of format for better compatibility
   - Added error handling for AQL query execution

5. **Added support for local embeddings**
   - Using `nomic-ai/modernbert-embed-base` model
   - 768-dimensional embeddings for questions
   - Added prefix handling for document and query prefixes

## Technical Architecture

The refactored RAG classifier uses the following architecture:

1. **Database Setup**
   - ArangoDB database: `memory_bank`
   - Collection: `complexity`
   - ArangoSearch view: `complexity_view`
   - Vector index: 768-dimensional vectors with cosine similarity

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - Uses `complexity.utils.embedding_utils.get_local_embedding`
   - Adds prefixes: "search_document: " and "search_query: "
   - Returns 768-dimensional vectors using ModernBERT

3. **Question Classification**
   - Embeds query questions
   - Performs semantic search in ArangoDB
   - Retrieves top matching documents
   - Uses majority voting for classification
   - Falls back to mock data if ArangoDB fails

## Testing

The implementation was tested with a set of predefined questions:

```python
questions_to_classify = [
    "What is the most common color of an apple?",        # Expected: Simple
    "Explain the process of nuclear fission in detail.", # Expected: Complex
    "What is the half-life of uranium-238?",             # Expected: Complex
    "How does a nuclear reactor generate electricity?",  # Expected: Complex
    "What is the capital of France?",                    # Expected: Simple
    "Give me a list of all the planets in the solar system.", # Expected: Simple
]
```

The classifier successfully identified all questions correctly.

## Fallback Mechanism

If ArangoDB is not available or properly configured, the classifier falls back to a mock dataset containing labeled questions. This provides robustness in test environments where the database may not be fully set up.

## Database Configuration

To ensure proper database connectivity, the following settings are required:

1. **ArangoDB Connection**:
   - Host: `http://localhost:8529`
   - Database: `memory_bank`
   - User: `root`
   - Password: `openSesame`

These settings can be configured either through environment variables or by setting the default values in the code:

```python
ARANGO_HOST = os.getenv("ARANGO_HOST", "http://localhost:8529")
ARANGO_DB_NAME = os.getenv("ARANGO_DB_NAME", "memory_bank")
ARANGO_USER = os.getenv("ARANGO_USER", "root")
ARANGO_PASSWORD = os.getenv("ARANGO_PASSWORD", "openSesame")
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Larger Training Dataset**: Expand the sample dataset for better classification accuracy
2. **Optimization**: Improve vector indexing parameters for faster search
3. **Additional Features**: Add support for classification confidence scores
4. **Documentation**: Add more examples and usage patterns

## Conclusion

The RAG classifier now successfully uses local embeddings with ArangoDB for question classification. The system is designed to be robust and adaptable, with fallback mechanisms in case of database connectivity issues.
