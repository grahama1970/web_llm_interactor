# Perplexity Stealth Automation: Recommendations

## Current Status

1. **Basic Functionality**:
   - The project can successfully connect to Perplexity.ai without a proxy
   - The CLI is working properly for task execution and configuration
   - Response capture is implemented but needs further testing

2. **BrightData Integration**:
   - We've identified authentication issues with the BrightData proxy
   - The proxy configuration in the code is correct according to BrightData's documentation
   - Error messages suggest credential validation problems

3. **Bot Detection**:
   - Without a proxy, we can access Perplexity.ai but get Cloudflare challenges when submitting queries
   - This confirms that residential proxies are necessary for full functionality

## Recommendations

### For BrightData Proxy Issues:

1. **Verify BrightData Credentials**:
   - Check that the API key in `.env` is current and valid
   - Verify the customer ID (hl_4da0a16e) is correct in the BrightData dashboard
   - Ensure the zone "residential" or "residential_proxy1" is properly set up in BrightData

2. **Alternative Proxy Configuration**:
   - Create a new zone in BrightData specifically for this project
   - Use the exact zone name shown in the dashboard without additional parameters
   - Test with the simpler format: `brd-customer-{CUSTOMER_ID}-zone-{ZONE_NAME}`

3. **Check Account Status**:
   - Ensure the BrightData account has sufficient credits remaining
   - Verify that the account is not blocked or limited
   - Check that the residential proxy service is active on your plan

### Alternative Solutions:

1. **Try a Different Proxy Provider**:
   - Consider alternative residential proxy services like SmartProxy, Oxylabs, or Luminati
   - Implement a different proxy provider in the code

2. **Implement Direct API Access**:
   - If available, use Perplexity's official API instead of browser automation
   - This would provide a more reliable and stable solution

3. **Add CAPTCHA Solving Service**:
   - Integrate a CAPTCHA solving service like 2Captcha or Anti-Captcha
   - This can help overcome Cloudflare challenges when using non-residential IPs

## Next Steps

1. Contact BrightData support to verify account and credentials
2. Create a fresh proxy zone in the BrightData dashboard for testing
3. Test with the simplified proxy configuration
4. If issues persist, consider the alternative solutions outlined above

## Further Testing

We've created several test scripts to help diagnose issues:
- `simple-test.js`: Tests basic connectivity to Perplexity
- `test-proxy.js`: Tests BrightData proxy connectivity
- `bd-simple.js`: Simplified BrightData testing

These can be used to verify individual components of the system.
